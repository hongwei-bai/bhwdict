# bhwdict
an open source free English-Chinese dictionary and study app

the code is old and need deep refactor.

The architecture is confused now and it does NOT adapt a lot of phone types, it could work though.

I am going to do it in near future.

Functions:
a. It provides English to Chinese dictionary look-up, which sources from a free-version of Oxford dictionary.

b. It provides English words and phrase study.

c. It applies TTS engine to speak word so users could check their hearing.
